# Game-Development Links
This is a collection of useful game-development links including, but not restricted to, development with MonoGame.

During the process of developing our game I came across a large variety of websites that I found very useful.  
This page is a collection of all of them baring a short description. I will check in every month or so and update this list accordingly.  
Let me mention that I didn't record those links in any particular order and that the sites, I link to in this section, may contain much more than the description of the link suggests. Chances are that I didn't even look through each and every page of every single site before finding it helpful and bookmarking it. These are just the pages I found searching for solutions for the problems in the various fields of interest you inevitably stumble over when starting to write a game.  

I tried to sort every link-table it in a way that should benefit your learning curve (most complex subjects last).  

**If you want to contribute just fork this repo, make changes and then a pull request.**

### General
* [**Shadow-Copying of applications**](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/29961/Shadow-Copying-of-Applications) - You want your installer to delete itself in windows?  You might come to a point where you'll end up writing your setup or updating your application, where you want to unload a program, that is currently running. In general that's not easily possible, but this project might help. We circumvented the issue by using a WIX setup (you are able to run programs before and afterwards that are not present on the disk, but in the GAC, which is very nice; We deleted the install-directory that way by running a C# deletion-program leaving no trace of the game whatsoever).
* [**Repositioning the cursor**](http://www.pinvoke.net/default.aspx/user32.setcursorpos) - You want to reposition or clamp the windows cursor to or within a window?  On a multi-monitor setup you should prevent the mouse cursor from leaving the monitor your customer is playing on. Here you'll find the proper interop-calls (I'm sure you know this site).

Furthermore it implements even a Stack-Based-FSM (SBFSM). So you may tell it to 'continue with the last state before the active one'. You describe your FSM using a nice and well documented DSL (Domain Specific Language).

## Libraries
Here you find game-engines, extensions, etc.

### Game Engines
* [**MonoGame**](http://www.monogame.net/) ![Github stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/MonoGame/MonoGame.svg) - XNA continued!  By leveraging C# and other .NET languages on Microsoft and Mono platforms you can write modern, fast, and reliable game code.

## Tools
Build tools, deployment tools, etc.

* [**ProtoBuild**](https://protobuild.org/) - If you wanna do cross-platform development this tool will help you to keep your project-files in order.

* [**wyBuild**](http://wyday.com/wybuild/features.php) - You want to have an updating game (maybe self-updating)?  A tool to create and deliver AND install updates manually or automatically in any given .NET language. This one saved and saves our butts during the alpha-testing stage.  

* [**Intel - Graphics Performance Analyzers**](https://software.intel.com/en-us/gpa) - A nice tool to get performance data from your GPU.

* [**Renderdoc**](https://github.com/baldurk/renderdoc) ![Github stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/baldurk/renderdoc.svg) - A sandalone graphics performance debugging tool. Nice work. Available on GitHub.

* [**Convert to Icon**](http://converticon.com/) - You want your own mouse-cursor?  When programming a game in XNA you come to a point when you want your own mouse-cursor. This program helps you to convert your image-files to an icon-file. And it's completely online.  

* [**DXT Compression**](http://code.google.com/p/libsquish/) - You want to compress the textures of your game on your own?  Normally you'd use the content-loader-pipeline of XNA (don't fear; the content-loader-pipeline does almost everything automatically), but if you can't use it, then you'll be stuck with this when you're trying to get compressed textures to your graphics-card.  

* [**Using Platform Specific Libraries from a Platform Agnostic Project**](http://code-jedi.com/blog/post/Using-Platform-Specific-Libraries-from-a-Platform-Agnostic-Project) - We've all had this problem. You want to use a library, but that comes in x86 or x64 flavor and your game should use the 'AnyCPU' target. This article describes how you can switch between the libraries on demand after editing the project file directly. Works like a charm, although it just determines the currently used context and replaces the files accordingly. So you cannot really build an 'AnyCPU' project using this method because the build-result will be fixed to the context used on your computer at compile-time.

* [**Asset Forge**](https://assetforge.io/) *(~20 USD)* Asset Forge allows anyone to create 3D models and 2D sprites using building blocks. Models are compatible with most available game engines.
  ### Installers And Setup

  * [Inno Setup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) - This is a nice, free for commercial use, installer that is surprisingly versatile. Not really suited for more complex stuff.
  * [WiX - Windows Installer XML](http://wixtoolset.org/) - THE gold standard for building setups. Can get pretty messy with more complex stuff though.
  * [NSIS](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page) - That's the installer package MonoGame uses for its installer. Nice to handle, open source.

## Legal Stuff And Licenses
One important thing: When searching for legal advice concerning licenses you'll be pretty much out of luck. Most of the time people tell you that they won't give 'legal advice' since the legal ramifications resulting from such an advice are just too awful.
So I won't do that either. You'll have to read for yourself and don't just take my word for it.
So, for what it's worth, here are some useful links and the comments are just my humble opinion.

* [**Comparison of free and open-source software licenses**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_free_and_open-source_software_licenses) - A very nice wiki-article with a nice table. For a quick lookup.
* [**Top 10 Copyright Myths**](http://www.copyrightservice.co.uk/copyright/copyright_myths) - A text from the UK Copyright Service. Thx to MrValentine from the MonoGame boards for finding it.

### Copyright
If you'd like to make money with your game, these licenses here are your friends. They allow you to use the code / asset / whatever, retain the original license, maybe do some sort of attribution of the original author, but don't prohibit you selling your work for money.

* [**Copyright**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright) - Explanation of copyright and what it's used for.
* [**Unlicense**](http://unlicense.org/) - Free for everything, including commercial use.
* [**MIT License**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License) - Also completely free. But don't remove the license.
* [**GNU LGPL**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License) - A little less permissive as the MIT license, but is not copyleft as its big brother the GPL.
* [**Apache License**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License) - Free for commercial use as far as I know.
* [**BSD Licenses**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses) - Free for commercial use as well.
* [*CC-BY*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CC-BY) - Free. But don't forget to attribute properly.
* [**Do What The Fuck You Want To Public License (WTFPL)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL) - I had to put it in here because of... well... you know... it's obvious, isn't it?

### Copyleft
Essentially and if there is no change in the text of the license in the work you're trying to use, the following licenses are viral.
If you use code under such a license, you'll have to adapt your license to theirs.
Not great if you'd like to make some money with your game later on.

* [**Copyleft**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft) - Explanation of copyleft and what it's used for.
* [**GNU GPL**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License) - Beware: Copyleft.
* [**CC-BY-SA**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CC-BY-SA) - Like CC-BY, but copyleft.

## Artistic Material
All the sites I link to in this paragraph contain "free for commercial use" material, although they may contain non-free material as well. It's your responsibility to check before you use it. 
You won't be able to dodge the fight with the even or odd license-text when dealing with creative content, so you might as well get over it and try to get a grasp on things.
